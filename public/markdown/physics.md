# 2 Particles and radiation

## 2.2 Electromagnetic radiation and quantum phenomena

### 2.2.1 The photoelectric effect

- The photoelectric effect is where electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the **surface of a metal** after absorbing EM radiation
  - provides evidence that light behaves as a particle - carried in discrete packets/quantised
- As the incident radiation intensity is increased
  - more photons are incident on the material per second
  - more photoelectrons are emitted per second

#### Threshold frequency

- The minimum frequency of incident EM radiation requried to remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
  - therefore, the threshold wavelength is the longest wavelength

#### Work Function ϕ

- The minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
- A single electron only absorbs one photon
  - so the absorbed photon must have energy equal to or high than Φ
  - photons with excess energy will have that energy transferred as kinetic energy to the photoelectron
- Not affected by the intensity of the incident radiation
  > Photons without enough energy will just scatter
- The energy required to release a photoelectron varies because some electrons are not on the surface of the metal
  - work is done to reach the surface before overcoming the work function

#### Stopping potential V<sub>s</sub>

- The potential difference required to stop photoelectron emission from occuring

  > - can be determined using a set of collector and emitter plates connected to a circuit
  > - a flow of electrons across the gap between the plates results in a emf
  > - as the current is turned up, the emitter plate becomes more positively charged
  > - electrons are attracted back towards the emitter plate - p.d. in gap opposes movement
  > - electrons are released with a range of kinetic energy
  > - some electrons have enough kinetic energy to overcome this attraction and cross the plate
  > - the p.d. at which no electrons can cross the gap is known as the stopping potential
  > - the rate of photoelectron release does not depend on p.d. once it is far away from stopping potential
  >   - constant current is reached when all released photoelectrons reach the anode

- Ek<sub>(max)</sub> is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, where <br>Ek<sub>(max)</sub> = e V<sub>s</sub>

#### The photoelectric equation

- The energy of a photon is<br>E = h f
- So, considering the work function, we have<br>h f = ϕ + Ek <sub>(max)</sub>
  <br>
  > - Ek<sub>(max)</sub> depends only on the frequency of the incident radiation and the work function

### 2.2.2 Collisions of electrons with atoms

- Electrons in an atom occupy discrete energy levels
  - they will attempt to occupy the lowest possible energy level, as this is the most stable configuration
- Electrons absorbs energy from an interaction (collision) with a photon or another electron
  - for photons, an exact amount of energy is needed
    - all of the photon energy is absorbed
  - for electrons, only a minimum energy is needed
    - electron can transfer only part of its energy and continue moving at a lower speed

#### Ionisation

- An atom gains or loses an orbital electron and becomes charged
  - The electron can come from any energy level
- Ionisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of an atom

#### Excitation

- An electron absorbs energy to move up to a higher energy level
  - by gaining energy from a collision
  - electron moves to a higher energy level
- An electron loses energy in dexctitaion by emitting a photon
  - electron moves to a lower energy level

#### In a fluorescent tube...

- Low-pressure mercury vapour with phosphor coating on tube
- A high potential difference is applied across the tube
  - this creates an electron flow from the cathode to the anode
- Electrons collide with the mercury atoms
- Ionisation occurs
  - electrons are released from mercury ions
- Exctiation occus in mercury atoms
  - free electrons collide with the mercury ions and are excited
  - these electrons are unstable and de-excite, emitting photons with UV wavelengths.
- Exctiation occurs
  - photons are absorbed by atoms in coating
  - atoms are excited/gain energy and its electrons move to higher energy levels (than n = 2)
  - photons have sufficient energy to promote electrons to high enough levels
- De-excitation occurs
  - photons are emitted by atoms in coating
  - atoms de-excite/lose energy and its electrons move to lower energy levels
  - electrons move to ground state via other energy levels (indirectly)
  - emitted radiation consists of (a range of) lower photon energies/frequencies or longer wavelength

#### The electronvolt

- When an electron travels through a potential difference, energy is transferred between two points
- from E = QV, <br>1 eV = 1.60 \* 10<sup>-19</sup> J - the energy gained by an electron travelling through a potential difference of 1V
  > This energy can be used to calculate the velocity of an electron, using E<sub>k</sub> = (1/2) m v<sup>2</sup>

### 2.2.3 Energy levels and photon emission

#### Line spectra

- Also known as atomic spectra
- Occurs when excited atoms emit visible light corresponding to different colours
- This can be observed as a series of lines with spaces in between
  - procides evidence that electrons in atoms can only transition between discrete energy levels

#### Emission spectra

- Dark background with coloured lines
- Explaination
  - electrons can only exist in discrete energy levels
  - when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, a single photon of EM radiation is emitted
  - the photon energy is equal to the difference in energy levels
  - each element has a specific set of energy level differences, so it corresponds to a different wavelength of light (E = h (c/λ))
  - the emitted photons go off in all directions, so the intensity in the original direction is reduced

#### Absorbtion spectra

- Continuous spectrum of colours with dark lines
  - lines coorespond with the differences in energy levels/the coloured lines in an emission spectra
  - formed by passing white light through a cool gas under low pressure
- Explaination
  - an electron can gain energy and transition into a higher energy level from absorbing a single photon, if the photon energy equals the difference in energy levels
  - these excited electrons de-excite and emit a single photon
  - the emitted photons go off in all directions, so some wavelengths appear to be missing

#### Discrete energy levels

- The difference between two discrete energy levels is equal to a specific photon energy emitted by a fluorescent tube/absorbed in a spectra<br>
  ∆E = h f = E<sub>1</sub> − E<sub>2 </sub>

### 2.2.4 Wave-particle duality

- Light can behave as a particle (i.e. have the properties of a particle)
  - photoelectric effect
    - EM radiation carry energy in discrete packets (photons)
- Light can also behave as a wave - diffraction and intereference in Young's double-slit experiment
  > Wave theory suggests
  >
  > - any frequency of light will have photoelectric emission - but a threshold frequency exists
  > - the energy absorbed will gradually increase with each wave - but energy is absorb instantaneously
  > - the kinetic energy of the emited electron will increase with intensity - but energy remains constant
  >   <br>
- Electrons can behave as a particle
- Electrons can also behave as a wave
  - electron diffraction
    - diffraction pattern is produced when an electron beam is directed at a thin graphite film
    - the material used to diffract electrons must have gaps similar in size to their de Broglie wavelength
      - so usually atomic lattices are used, e.g. graphite, which has a crystalline structure
    - diffraction pattern is a series of concentric rings
      - if electrons had particle behaviour, they woild be distributed uniformly across the screen

#### de Broglie wavelength

- Increasing p.d. increases the speed of an electron
- which increases the momentum of an electron
- which decreases its angle of diffraction
- thus the diameter of the ring decreases
  <br>
- Therefore, the smaller the momentum of an electron, the greater the de Broglie wavelength<br>λ = h / p = h / (m v)
  > This concurs with wave properties, angle of diffraction increases as wavelength increases

#### Developing theories

- Knowledge and understanding of the nature of matter changes over time
- This need to be evaluated through peer review and validated by the scientific community

# 3 Waves

## 3.1 Progressive and stationary waves

### 3.1.1 Progressive waves

- Amplitude
  - the maximum displacement of a particle in the wave from its equilibrium position
- Frequency
  - the number of waves passing a point each second
- Wavelength
  - the distance between points on successive oscillations of the wave that are in phase
- Speed
  - the distance travelled by the wave per unit time
- Phase
  - the position of a point on a wave
  - may be measured as angles (radians and degrees) or as fractions of a cycle
- Phase Difference
  - the "distance" a wave is behind another
  - may be measured as angles (radians and degrees) or as fractions of a cycle
- Period - the time taken for one full oscillation
  <br>
- Two waves are in phase if they are both at the same point in the cycle; i.e. their phase difference 2π rad.
- Two waves are in antiphase if their phase difference is π rad.
  <br>
- Progressive waves - waves which transfer energy from one point to another without transferring material (i.e. causing permanent displacement of the medium) - all points have the same amplitude in each period
  > Always refer to:
  >
  > - (both) waves interfere
  > - path difference varies
  > - phase difference varies
  > - produces maxima and minima
  > - recieved signal goes through series of maxima and minma
  >
  > When asked to compare:
  >
  > - refer to phase
  > - refer to frequency
  > - refer to speed

### 3.1.2 Longitudinal and transverse waves

- Transverse waves - waves oscillations perpendicular to direction of propagation - examples: - EM waves - vibrations on a string - S-waves - can be polarised - has crests and troughs - can be demonstrated with a vertical slinky
  <br>
- Longitudinal waves - waves oscillations parallel to direction of propagation - examples: - sound waves - P-waves - cannot be polarised - has areas of compression and rarefaction - can be demonstrated with a horizontal slinky
  <br>
- Polarisation - oscillations occur in only one plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation - this plane is known as the plane of polarisation - can only occur in transverse waves - because transverse waves oscillate planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation - can be used in: - polaroid sunglasses - light reflecting from reflective surfaces (e.g. puddles) undergo partial plane polarisation - polaroid sunglasses polarise the light so reduces glare - radio/microwave signals - radio and television signals are usually vertically polarised or horizontally polarised - therefore aerials need to be mounted flat (horizontal) or on its side (vertical)
  > When answering scenairos related to polarisation, make use of "maximum" and "minimum"
  > Always link back - "max occurs when aerial is aligned with plane of polarisation of the wave"
- All EM waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum - 3 \* 10<sup>8</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>

### 3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves

- Superposition - when two or more waves with the same frequency arrive at a point, the resultant displacement is the sum of the displacements of each wave - if both waves have the same amplitude, they will meet: - in phase - constructive interference - in anti-phase - destructive interference
  <br>

- Stationary waves

  - produced by the superposition/interference of two waves of the same frequency and similar amplitude travelling in **opposite directions**
  - can be created with a progressive wave and its reflection
  - stores energy
  - wave pattern does not move along the direction of propagraion
  - has nodes and antinodes
    - nodes are regions with no oscillation
      - destructive interference occurs
    - antinodes are regions with maximum displacement
      - constructive interference occurs
  - can either be in phase or out of phase
    - between nodes - in phase
    - odd number of nodes between - out of phase / antiphase
    - even number of nodes between - in phase
  - all points have different amplitudes
  - lowest frequency for formation is the first harmonic
  - examples:
    - strings
      - vibrations from stationary waves on stretched strings produce sound waves
      - at resonant frequencies, a whole number of half wavelengths will fit on the length of the string
    - microwaves
      - a microwave source can be placed in line with a reflector
      - a detector can be moved around to detect nodes and antinodes
    - sound
      - can be produced as a result of the formation of stationary waves inside a closed air column
      - there must be a node at one end and an antinode at the speaker end

- Harmonics
  - wave patterns of stationary waves
  - can be observed on a string with two fixed ends
    <br>
  - first harmonic
    - 2 nodes, 1 antinode
    - f = v/2L
  - second harmonic
    - 3 nodes, 2 antinodes
    - f = v/L
  - third harmonic - 4 nodes, 3 antinodes - f = 3v/2L
    <br>
  - wave speed on a string can be given by<br>v = sqrt(T/μ)
  - therefore, the frequency of the first harmonic is<br>f = 1/2L \* sqrt(T/μ)

## 3.2 Refraction, diffraction and interference

### 3.2.1 Interference

- Coherence
  - waves have the same frequency and a constant phase difference
  - waves undergoing constructive or destructive interference must be coherent
- Path difference - the difference in the distance travelled by two waves from their sources to the point where they meet - determines the type of interference - constructive : nλ - destructive : (n + 1/2)λ - expressed in multiples of wavelength
  <br>
- Intensity of a wave is proportional to the amplitude ^ 2 - intensity of a wave (power per unit area) is proportional to the energy transferred by the wave - energy transferred by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude
  <br>
- Interference can be shown with a laser
  - lasers are coherent and monochromatic (same wavelength)
  - constructive interference is shown with maxima (light fringes)
  - destructive interference is shown with minima (dark fringes)
  - but lasers have safety issues
    - high energy light beam may cause permanent eye damage
- Interference can be shown with sound waves
  - sound waves are longitudinal
  - constructive interference is heard with a louder sound
  - destructive interference is heard with no sound
- Interference can be shown with microwaves - constructive interference is shown with higher amplitude on detector - destructive interference is shown with lower amplitude on detector
  <br>
- Double slit interference - superposition of waves from both slits - diffraction patterns overlap and interfere constructively - produces a interference pattern using two coherent sources - can be a single source passing through a double slit - light diffracts to both slits, and has a fixed path difference - each bright fringe has the same width - waves further away from the central maxima will have lower intensity as their waves have to travel further (reduced coherence) - to calculate fringe spacing:<br>W = (λD)/s<br>Fringe spacing = (wavelength \* distance from slit to screen) / slit spacing - D has to be much larger than other dimensions
  <br>
- History
  - Isaac Newton (1670s)
    - light is a stream of particles known as corpuscles
      - could not explain interference or diffraction
  - Christaan Huygens (1670s)
    - wave theory of light
      - series of wavefronts where every point is a source of wave
  - Thomas Young (1800s)
    - double slit experiment
      - shows light as a wave
  - James Maxwell (1860s)
    - electric and magnetic fields obeyed wave equation
  - Albert Einstein (1900s)
    - light as a particle - photoelectric effect
    - photons - wave-particle duality

### 3.2.2 Diffraction

- Diffraction - the spreading out of waves when they pass through a gap/around an obstacle - examples: - water waves through gaps in harbours - radio waves around buildings
  <br>
- Monochromatic diffraction - central maximum is: - double the width of the other fringes - much brighter - as order increases, the fringes have less intensity - dark fringes have zero intensity
  <br>
- White light diffraction - central maxima is: - white - equal intensity to monochromatic light - much wider than other fringes - much brighter than other fringes - all other maxima are spectra - less intense than monochromatic light - shortest wavelength (violet) - closest to central maxima - longest wavelength (red) - furthest from central maxima - spectra eventually merge as wavelengths increase/decrease - fringe spacing decreases - red wavelengths increase, blue wavelengths decrease
  <br>
- Factors affecting single slit diffraction - slit width - decrease -> greater angle of diffraction -> greater width of maxima, but lower intensity - slit width = wavelength: greatest diffraction - slit width < wavelength: less diffraction, some waves are reflected, spreads out less - slit width > wavelength: less diffraction, spreads out more - slit width >> wavelength: no diffaction occurs - slit width << wavelength: no diffaction occurs - wavelength - increase -> greater angle of diffraction -> greater width of maxima - red light has wider fringes than blue light
  <br>
- Diffraction grating - creates a diffraction pattern: - monochromatic light -> fringes - white light -> different components - has a large number of thin, equally spaced slits on a glass plate - creates a sharper pattern than a double slit - more useful when measuring wavelength - maximum angle of diffraction is when the beam is at right angles to the grating ⇒ sinθ = 1 - ⇒ highest order visible:<br> n = d / λ, n ∈ ℕ
  <br>
- Diffraction grating equation - consider the first order maximum - path difference = λ - form a right angles triangle with hypotenuse (slit separation) and opposite λ - ⇒ sinθ = λ / d - all maxima occur when the path difference is nλ, n ∈ ℕ - ⇒ dsinθ = nλ
  <br>
- Diffraction gratings are used in
  - spectrometers
    - analyse light from stars to investigate their composition
    - measure red/blue shift
  - x-ray crystallography
    - x-rays are directed at a thin crystal sheet acting as a diffraction grating to form a diffraction pattern
    - wavelength of x-rays are similar in size to the gaps between atoms
    - can be used to measure atomic spacing in materials
  - monochromators
    - to analyse a wavelength emitted by molecules in diseased cells

### 3.2.3 Refraction at a plane surface

- Refractive index - how much a material slows down light passing through it (ratio of how fast light travels compared to in vacuum) - in air, n = 1 - given by<br> n = c/c<sub>s</sub> - higher refractive index (n > 1) = optically dense
  <br>
- Refraction - wave speed is different in the more optically dense material - so the edge of a wavefront slows down or speed up when entering that material - but the part of the wave not in the material continues at a different speed
  <br> - denser medium -> slower wave speed (shorter wavelength) - therefore light bends towards the normal - less dense medium -> faster wave speed (longer wavelength) - therefore light bends away from the normal
  <br>
- Snell’s law - n<sub>1</sub>sinθ<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>sinθ<sub>2</sub>
  <br>
- Total internal reflection - when the angle of refraction is 90° - light is refracted along the boundary - angle of incidence is known as the critical angle θ<sub>c</sub> - we can therefore derive that<br>sinθ<sub>c</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> = sinθ<sub>1</sub>/sinθ<sub>2</sub> - when the angle of incidence > θ<sub>c</sub>, and n<sub>1</sub> > n<sub>2</sub>,: - total internal reflection occurs - when the angle of incidence < θ<sub>c</sub>: - refraction occurs - when the angle of incidence = θ<sub>c</sub>: - light is refracted along the boundary - materials with a higher refractive index are more likely to have total internal reflection
  <br>
- Fibre optics - total internal reflection occurs inside optical fibres - light refracts upon entering fibres - refracts out of fibres - light is monochromatic - a step-index fibre consists of - optically dense core tube (glass) - lower density cladding - protects thin core from damage - prevents signal degradation from light escaping - keeps core separate to prevent information crossover - outer sheath
  <br>
- Absorption
  - fibre absorbs part of the signal's energy
    - reduces the amplitude of the signal
    - loss of information
  - to reduce absorption:
    - use an extremely transparent core
    - use repeaters to regenerate pulse
- Pulse broadening - caused by modal and material dispersion - leads to pulses merging - loss of information - to reduce pulse broadening: - use narrow core - use a monochromatic source - use repeaters to regenerate pulse - use a single-mode fibre (only a single wavelength of light)
  <br>
- Material dispersion
  - leads to pulse broadening
  - white light is separated into different wavelengths of the spectrum
  - light is dispersed as different wavelengths have different speeds in a medium
    - shorter wavelength -> slower wave speed
    - smaller angle of incidence -> smaller angle of reflection
    - undergoes total internal reflection more times
- Modal dispersion
  - leads to pulse broadening
  - monochromatic light is dispersed
    - each part of the wavefront has a different angle of incidence
    - some waves undergo total internal reflection more times
  - the core is very narrow to prevent this

# 4 Mechanics and materials

## 4.1 Force, energy and momentum

### 4.1.1 Scalars and vectors

- A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction
- A scalar is a quantity that only has magnitude

### 4.1.2 Moments

- Moment - the turning effect of a force - given by<br>force × perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force
  <br>
- Principle of moments - for a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments (about the same point)
  <br>
- Couples - a pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces - force × perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces
  <br>
- Centre of mass - the point at which the weight of the object is considered to act - the position of the centre of mass o - f uniform regular solid is at its centre - for symmetrical objetcs with uniform density, the centre of mass is at the point of symmetry
  <br> - an object is stable when its centre of mass lies above its base

### 4.1.3 Motion along a straight line

- Displacement
  - distance from a fixed point
- Speed
  - total distance travelled per unit time (rate of change of distance)
- Velocity
  - rate of change of displacement
- Acceleration - rate of change of velocity
  <br>
- velocity–time
  - gradient: acceleration
  - area: total displacement
- acceleration–time
  - area: change in velocity
- displacement–time
  - gradient: velocity

### 4.1.4 Projectile motion

- Friction - a force which opposes the motion of an object
  ->> moar friction need wrt acceleration
  <br>
- Lift forces
  - upwards force on an object moving through a fluid
  - perpendicular to fluid flow
  - caused by a change in direction of fluid flow
- Drag forces - opposite direction to motion - does not speed up an object - converts kinetic energy into other forms
  <br>
- Terminal speed - as an object falls through a fluid, the gravitational force is greater than the frictional force. - the object accelerates - as speed increases, the frictional force increases. - due to Newton’s Second Law, the resultant force and therefore acceleration decreases - eventually, the frictional force is equal to the gravitational force, and the resultant force is zero - the object will move at its terminal velocity
  <br>
- Air resistance
  - increases with speed
  - affected by:
    - cross-sectional area
    - shape
    - altitude
    - temperature
    - humidity
  - decreases the horizontal component of velocity in a projectile

### 4.1.5 Newton’s laws of motion

- First law
  - An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force
    - Inertia
- Second law
  - The resultant force acting on an object with a constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration<br>F = ma
- Third law
  - For each force experienced by an object, the object exerts an equal and opposite force
    - The force pair has:
      - same type of force
      - same magnitude
      - opposite direction
      - different objects

> When describing using Newton's laws of motion:
>
> - describe using all laws
> - state direction of all forces
> - exerts force instead of displace water/gas
> - refer to the object stated in question - gas accelerated

### 4.1.6 Momentum

- Linear momentum
  - defined as<br>p = mv
  - momentum in one direction
  - remains constant unless the system is acted upon by an external resultant force
- Conservation of linear momentum - The total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after a collision, provided no external force acts
  <br>
- External forces
  - forces that act on a system from outside
  - e.g. friction
- Internal forces - forces exchanged by particles within the system - e.g. tension in a string
  <br>
- Force
  - the rate of change of momentum <br>F = ∆(mv)/∆t
- Impulse - change in momentum - or the product of the force applied and time<br> ∆p = F∆t = mv - mu - (where the force is constant) - therefore a small force acting over a long time has the same effect as a large force acting over a short time
  <br>
- Force–time graph - Area: impulse
  <br>
- Impact forces - reduced by increasing contact time - lowers risk of injury
  <br>
- Elastic and inelastic collisions - momentum is always conserved in collisions and explosions - elastic collisions - kinetic energy is conserved - usually colliding objects move in opposite direction - inelastic collisions - kinetic energy is not conserved - usually colliding objects stick together
  <br>
- Momentum conservation issues
  - force of impact in a vehicle collision can be decreased by increasing the contact time
    - this is achieved through safety features
      - crumple zones
        - designed to crush/crumple
        - increases the time it takes for the momentum to decrease
      - seat belts
        - stops occupants colliding with the interior
        - stretches slightly to increase the time it takes for the momentum to decrease
      - airbags
        - soft cushion to prevent injury
        - increases the time it takes for the momentum to decrease
    - "absorbs" energy from an impact

### 4.1.7 Work, energy and power

- Work done - the amount of energy transferred when an external force causes an object to move over a certain distance<br>W = Fs cosθ - work can be done "against" a force, e.g. friction - some energy is dissipated to to the surroundings
  <br>
- Power - rate of doing work = rate of energy transfer<br>P = ΔW/Δt = Fv
  <br>
- Force–displacement graph - Area: work done - useful for variable forces
  <br>
- Efficiency
  - efficiency = useful output power/input power

### 4.1.8 Conservation of energy

- Conservation of energy - energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another
  <br>
- Dissipation of energy - no energy transfer is 100% efficient - some energy is dissipated to the surroundings - this is usually wasted as it can not be used
  <br>
- Gravitational potential energy<br>∆E<sub>p</sub> = mg∆h
  - energy stored in mass due to its position in a gravitational field
- Kinetic energy <br>E<sub>k</sub> = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>
  - energy an object has due to its motion

## 4.2 Materials

### 4.2.1 Bulk properties of solids

#### Density

- Mass per unit volume<br>ρ = m/v

#### Hooke's kaw

- A material that obeys hooke's law has extension that is directly proportional to the force applied up to the limit of proportionality<br>F = kΔL
- The stiffer the material, the higher the spring constant k
  <br>
- Limit of proportionality
  - point beyond which Hooke's law no longer holds
- Elastic limit
  - point beyond which the material will no longer return to its original shape (length)

#### Tensile forces

- Tensile forces are stretching forces which act on a material
- Tensile stress
  - force exerted per unit area (Pa) <br>σ = F/A
  - a material is able to support up to its ultimate tensile stress, at which point it breaks
- Tensile strain - extention per unit length<br>ε = ΔL/L
  <br>
- Stress-strain graphs
  - describes the properties of materials
  - yield stress
    - material extends plastically for a small increase in stress
  - breaking point
    - breaking stress - the maximum stress a material can stand before it fractures
  - elastic region
    - before elastic limit
  - plastic region
    - after elastic limit
  - elastic strain energy per unit volume
    - area under elastic portion

#### Elastic strain energy

- Work is done to stretch a material
- For a material obeying Hooke's law, work done is stored as elastic strain energy<br>E = (1/2)F∆L
  - which is also the area under a force-extention graph

#### Spring energy

- When a (vertical) spring is extended and contracted, energy is transferred between different stores
- As the spring is stretched, elastic potential energy increases
- As the stretching force is removed, kinetic energy increases
- Kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy
- and vice versa

#### Plastic behaviour

- There are 2 types of deformation: - elastic deformation - objects return to their original shape when the stretching force is removed - plastic deformation - objects remain stretched and do not return to their original shape when the stretching force is removed
  <br>
- Brittle materials
  - small plastic region
  - low breaking stress
- Ductile
  - large plastic region
  - high breaking stress

#### Energy conservation issues

- When a stretching force is removed, the material is unloaded
  <br>
- After an object undergoes plastic deformation, the unloading curve on a force-extention graph will not pass through the origin - the object is permanently extended - the area between the loading and unloading curves is the work done to deform the wire
  <br>
- the unloading curve is always below the loading curve - some energy may be transferred into other energy stores, e.g. thermal for rubber bands
  <br>
- In a vehicle, a suspension system is used to provide comfortable handling of a vehicle
  - elastic shock absorbers dampen movements of the springs
    - kinetic energy from the car is converted into thermal energy
  - seatbelts are made of elastic materials to convert kinetic energy into elastic strain energy

### 4.2.2 The Young modulus

- The ability of a material to withstand changes in length with an added load - i.e. the stiffness of a material
  <br>
- For a material which obey's Hooke's law, stress is proportional to strain
- therefore the ratio of tensile stress and tensile strain is constant
- therefore:<br>E (Pa) = Tensile stress/Tensile strain = FL/∆LA
  <br>
- When considering springs/materials with the same Young modulus but different diameter/length, this rearrangement may be useful<br>k = E (A/L)

# 5 Electricity

## 5.1 Current electricity

### 5.1.1 Basics of electricity

- Current is the rate of flow of charge
  - I = ∆Q / ∆t
- Potential difference is the work done per unit charge
  - V = W / Q
- Resistance is how difficult it is for charge carriers to get past a component
  - R = V / I

### 5.1.2 Current–voltage characteristics

- Ohm's law states that I ∝ V under constant physical conditions.
- We need to consider 3 types of component: - Ohmic conductor - follows Ohm's law<br>V = I R - graph is directly proportional - Semiconductor diode - forward bias: near 0 until threshold voltage, then increases dramatically - reverse bias: slightly below 0 until reverse breakdown voltage, then decreases dramatically - because resistance is very high during reverse bias - Filament lamp - the wire in the lamp heats up as current increases, therefore its resistance increases, - at low currents, Ohm's law is obeyed as the component does not heat up much.
  > Remember the order of the axes! Normally, it will be I (vertical) and V (horizontal)
- Ammeters have 0 resistance to not affect the reading of current
- Voltmeters have infinite resistance so no current can flow through them
  - it takes all the p.d. if it is the only path

### 5.1.3 Resistivity

- Resistivity is the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it<br>ρ = RA / L
- It is dependent on environmental factors, e.g. temperature
  - Metal conductors
    - when temperature increases, resistance increases.
    - metal ions gain more kinetic energy and vibrate more
    - so charge carriers (i.e. electrons) collide with the ions more frequently
    - charge carriers slow down
    - current decreases
  - Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors
    - when temperature increases, resistance decreases
    - electrons are bumped up from the valence band to the conduction band
    - so the number of charge carriers increases
    - so current increases
    - the resistance/temperature graph is non-linear - the downwards gradient is steeper at the start
- Superconductors are materials which have zero resistivity at/below a critical **temperature**
  - the critical temperature varies for different materials, but is usually close to 0K
  - They can be used in:
    - power cables, to reduce energy loss through heating
    - strong magnetic fields, which are used for maglev trains or medical equipment
  - The resistance/temperature graph is non-linear and drops dramatically to 0 at the critical temperature

### 5.1.4 Circuits

#### Series circuits

- Potential difference is shared in proportion to resistance<br>V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + ...
  - a "potential drop" occurs across each component
    - the amount of drop is calculated with Ohm's law<br> V = I R
- Current is constant<br>I<sub>total</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub> = ...
- Resistance adds up<br>R<sub>total</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + ...

#### Parallel circuits

- Potential difference is constant across all branches
  V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> = ...
- Current is shared between branches
  I<sub>total</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + ...
- Resistors in parallel reduces total resistance
  R<sub>total</sub><sup>-1</sup> = R<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup> + R<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup> + ...

#### Battery cells:

- Series:
  -     V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + ...
  - Cancels out in opposite directions
- Parallel:
  - V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> = ...
- For both cases, the current remains unchanged. - Each cell provides less power/energy in parallel, so they last longer, and reduces internal resistance.
  <br>
- Power is rate of transfer of energy:
  - P = I V = I<sup>2</sup> R = V<sup>2</sup>/R
- Energy: - E = P t = I V t
  <br>
- In DC circuits, charge and energy are conserved:
  - Kirchoff's first law: the current flowing into a node/junction must be equal to the current flowing out of it
    - Q = I t, so this proofs conservation of charge
  - Kirchoff's second law: the sum of all voltages across components which supply electrical energy must equal the sum of all voltages across the other components in the same loop
    - E = I V t, so this proofs conservation of energy.

### 5.1.5 Potential divider

- A potential divider is used to supply constant or variable potential difference from a power supply with constant p.d.
- This is achieved with several resistors in series across a source of p.d.
  - this includes variable resistors, or semiconductor components, e.g. LDRs.
- Potential dividers can used as control circuts to trigger events.
  - e.g. when light intensity falls, resistance across the LDR will increase, so the current decreases (as I = V / R), so there is less shared of p.d. across the fixed resistor.

### 5.1.6 Electromotive force and internal resistance

- All cells have an internal resistance
  - caused by charge carriers (electrons) colliding with atoms/ions inside the cell, which leads to energy loss
  - represented as a resistor inside the battery in a circuit diagram
- Electromotive force (emf) is the amount of energy provided by the battery (i.e. transferred from chemical energy to electrical energy) for every coulomb of charge (Q) passing through.
  ε = E / Q = I (R + r)
- Total resistance = internal resistance + load resistance
  <br>
- The p.d. across the load resistor is known as the terminal p.d. (V)
- The p.d. across the internal resistor is known as lost volts (V)
  - it is the energy wasted by the cell per coulomb of charge
- emf = terminal p.d. + lost volts
- The emf can be measured using a voltmeter across a cell when no current is running through it.
